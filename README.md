# Project Guidelines for Collaboration

Welcome to the **Menkorakure** project! This document outlines the steps and rules to help you collaborate effectively with your team. Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth workflow and clean codebase. Remember, teamwork and organization are key to success in this project!

## Project Structure

### Branching System
- **Main Branch**:  
  The `main` branch is the final and stable version of the project.  
  **It is sacred** and should only be updated after all levels are completed and reviewed.
  
- **Level Branches**:  
  There are six level branches: `level1`, `level2`, `level3`, `level4`, `level5`, and `level6`.  
  Each level branch acts as the main branch for tasks related to that specific level.

## How to Contribute to the Project

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. **Start by Pulling Changes from Your Level Branch**:  
   Always pull the latest changes from your level branch before starting your task.  
   ```bash
   git checkout levelX   # Replace X with your level number (1-6)
   git pull origin levelX
   ```

2. **Create a New Branch for Your Task**:  
   While on your level branch, create a new branch for your specific task.  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-name
   ```

3. **Work on Your Task**:  
   Make the necessary changes for your task. Keep the code clean and organizedâ€”donâ€™t put everything into one file. Maintain a good folder structure and separation of concerns.  
   Refer to [this project](https://github.com/InvadingOctopus/comedot) as an example of a clean and well-structured repository.

4. **Push Your Task Branch**:  
   Push your task branch to the remote repository.  
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/task-name
   ```

5. **Send a Pull Request (PR)**:  
   - Send a PR from your task branch (e.g., `feature/task-name`) to your respective level branch (e.g., `levelX`).
   - Write a clear title and description for your PR explaining what changes you made.

6. **Review and Merge**:  
   - Someone from your level (or the level manager) will review your PR.  
   - If everything looks good, they will merge it into the level branch.  
   - If there are no conflicts, you may also merge your PR to the level branch yourself (if allowed by your team).

---

## Merging to the Main Branch

- Once all tasks in a level are completed, the level branch (e.g., `level1`) will send a PR to the `main` branch.
- The **project managers** will review the changes to ensure everything is working correctly.
- After thorough testing and review, they will merge the level branch into the `main` branch.

---

## Reminders for Everyone

- **Collaborate Smartly**: Always pull changes from your level branch before starting a new task to avoid conflicts.
- **Branching Discipline**: Always create your task branch from your level branch, **not from `main`**.
- **Keep it Clean**: Follow a proper folder structure and avoid putting everything into one file. This will make integration easier later.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep related files and code together while ensuring tasks are modular and easy to understand.

### Example Workflow
1. Pull changes from `levelX`:
   ```bash
   git checkout levelX
   git pull origin levelX
   ```

2. Create a branch for your task:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-name
   ```

3. Work on your task and commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature/task-name"
   ```

4. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/task-name
   ```

5. Open a PR to `levelX` and wait for review.

### Final Note
We understand that time is limited, but try your best to keep the project clean and organized. Following these guidelines will make integration much easier later. Letâ€™s work together and do our best to make this project a success!

Good luck, everyone! ðŸŽ‰
